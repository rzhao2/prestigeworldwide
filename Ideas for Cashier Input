Ideas for Cashier input
Problem: Cashier needs to put in information about inventory in the beginning of the day, and this information needs to be updated
Tradeoff: Accuracy, up-to-dateness of information vs adding more of a burden for the cashier
Beginning of the day ideas:
•	Program has list of items
•	Connections workers should be able to create a new item, uploading a picture, nutrition facts, etc
•	Connections workers can save combinations of items, and edit them at the beginning of the day

Updating ideas:
•	Possibility 1: Constant updating
  o	Could make line waits even longer
  o	Would require exact counts
  o	Cashiers have to enter information anyway in the status quo—if we could interface with that program, we could have constant updating without an extra human step. (We need to be more aggressive about getting in touch with them.)
•	Possibility 2: Imperfect updating
  o	Consumer would have to wait until order was bagged, not placed, for confirmation that the item was still in stock and will be ready
  o	Could have “warning lights” where, when an item looks like it’s going to run out soon, cashier uses program to post a warning (or disables the item online)
